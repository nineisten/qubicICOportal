**Qubic ICO Portal (QIP) + QX Integration – Updated Project Summary**  
*GitHub: [github.com/nineisten/qubicICOportal](https://github.com/nineisten/qubicICOportal)*

---

### **Project Name**: Qubic Instant Launchpad with QX-Powered Liquidity & Revenue Distribution (QIP+QX)

---

### **Core Vision**
A **fully automated, permissionless, and trustless** token launch platform on the **Qubic blockchain** that seamlessly combines:
- **Instant ICOs** with zero barriers
- **Immediate liquidity** via the QX decentralized exchange
- **Automatic revenue sharing** across ecosystem stakeholders

> **Launch. List. Trade. Earn — all in one tick.**

---

### **Key Features**

| Feature | Description |
|-------|-----------|
| **Instant Token Launch** | Any project can deploy a new token in a single step — no voting, no delays, no approvals. |
| **Fixed Revenue Split** | 95% of all ICO proceeds go to the **CCF Treasury** (immutable), 5% distributed pro-rata to **QIP Ownership Token** holders. |
| **Automatic QX Listing** | Upon launch, a portion of the token supply is **automatically placed on QX** as initial sell orders. |
| **Secondary Market Access** | Token units function as tradable "shares" on QX, enabling instant liquidity and price discovery. |
| **Passive Income Loop** | Trading activity on QX generates fees — benefiting QX shareholders and indirectly supporting the QIP ecosystem. |
| **Deflationary by Design** | All QUBIC used in launches and trades is permanently burned, reducing total supply over time. |
| **Zero Admin Risk** | No pause functions, no overrides, no central control — fully on-chain and immutable. |

### **End-to-End Flow**

1. **Project launches token** through QIP  
2. **Funds are split instantly**:  
   - 95% → CCF Treasury  
   - 5% → QIP Ownership Token holders  
3. **Initial supply auto-listed** on QX as sell orders  
4. **Trading begins immediately** on the QX order book  
5. **Fees from trading** flow to QX shareholders  
6. **QUBIC is burned** with every transaction  
7. **Ecosystem grows** — more volume, more burns, more value

### **Token & Share Model**

| **QIP Ownership Token** | Fixed token receiving 5% of every ICO |
| **QX Shares (676 total)** | Earn passive income from **all QX trading volume**, including your token |

> Holders benefit in **two layers**:  
> - Direct 5% revenue from every QIP launch  
> - Indirect gains from increased QX trading volume
